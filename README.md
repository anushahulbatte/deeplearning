Deep learning Project 

The repository contains a notebook for task 1. This notebook includes a 1D-CNN to annotate protein sequences and determine whether they perform a certain function or not. The code contains multiple modifications to the hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model to return a high test accuracy and a low test error. Some of the modifications to the hyperparameters include changing learning rates, dropout rates, weight decay and trying a different optimizer (SGD) to test effect of changing the momentum. 
Furtermore, some modifications were also made to the architecture to further improve the performance. This architectural changes include adding a batch normalization and changing the kernel size.
